HEY! I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. I've learned much in it's creation.

How to make this work:

Step1: Generate an API token -----> https://yourcompanyname.syncromsp.com/api_tokens

Step2: Modify and then run the set_environment_variables.py script. You and I shouldn't hardcode API keys. It is a security nightmare.

Step3: Use the "from syncro_python_wrapper import *" to start creating your own scripts. Use the template_script.py to assist if you need an example.
